## Environment Setup and GPU Check

The notebook begins by checking whether a GPU is available using a shell command. This ensures that you are leveraging a GPU for training if available. It also installs the necessary libraries using pip.

```python
# Check GPU availability
gpu_info = !nvidia-smi
gpu_info = '\n'.join(gpu_info)
if gpu_info.find('failed') >= 0:
    print('Not connected to a GPU')
else:
    print(gpu_info)

# Install required libraries
!pip install tensorflow
!pip install keras
```

**Explanation:**  
- The output of `nvidia-smi` is captured and printed to show GPU details.
- If there’s an issue with the GPU, a corresponding message is printed.
- The TensorFlow and Keras libraries are installed to ensure the environment is set up correctly.

## Data Loading and Initial Exploration

The CIFAR-10 dataset is loaded using Keras’ built-in functions. The dataset is divided into training and test sets, and the test labels are reshaped. Additionally, a helper function is defined to visualize sample images along with their class labels.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import datasets, layers, models
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load CIFAR-10 dataset
(xtrain, ytrain), (xtest, ytest) = datasets.cifar10.load_data()
ytest = ytest.reshape(-1,)
print(ytest)

# Define class names for CIFAR-10
classname = ["airplane", "automobile", "bird", "cat", "deer", "dog", "frog", "horse", "ship", "truck"]

# Define a helper function to visualize an image and its class label
def example(x, y, index):
    plt.figure(figsize=(15,2))
    plt.imshow(x[index])
    plt.xlabel(classname[y[index]])

# Display examples from the test set
example(xtest, ytest, 8)
example(xtest, ytest, 10)
example(xtest, ytest, 200)
```

**Explanation:**  
- The CIFAR-10 dataset is loaded, with training and test splits.
- The `ytest` labels are reshaped to a 1D array.
- A list `classname` holds the names corresponding to the numerical labels.
- The `example()` function displays an image from the dataset along with its label.

## Data Preprocessing

Normalization is performed to scale the pixel values from [0, 255] to [0, 1].

```python
# Normalize pixel values for both training and testing datasets
xtrain = xtrain / 255.0
xtest = xtest / 255.0
```

**Explanation:**  
Normalizing the image data helps in faster convergence during training and is a standard pre-processing step for CNNs.

---

## Model Construction

A sequential CNN model is defined using TensorFlow/Keras with the following architecture:
- An explicit input layer corresponding to the image shape.
- Two blocks of convolution and max pooling layers.
- A flattening layer and two dense layers, with the final dense layer using softmax activation for multi-class classification.

```python
from keras.layers import Input

# Construct the CNN model
model = models.Sequential([
    Input(shape=(32, 32, 3)),  # Define the input shape
    layers.Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=(3,3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2,2)),

    layers.Conv2D(filters=64, kernel_size=(3,3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2,2)),

    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(64, activation="relu"),
    layers.Dense(10, activation="softmax")
])

# Display the model architecture in textual format
model
model.summary()
```

**Model Visualization and Saving**

A graphical representation of the model is generated and saved as `model_plot.png`, and the model is saved to `my_model.h5`.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.utils import plot_model

plot_model(
    model,
    to_file='model_plot.png',
    show_shapes=True,
    show_layer_names=True,
    show_dtype=True,            # Optionally shows data types
    expand_nested=True,         # Expands nested models if any
    show_layer_activations=True # Shows activation functions
)

# Save the model to a file for later use or sharing
model.save('my_model.h5')
```

**Explanation:**  
- The model summary prints layer details and parameter counts.
- The `plot_model` function creates a static diagram of the network.
- Saving the model allows for reloading without reconstructing it.

## Model Compilation and Training

The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and the sparse categorical crossentropy loss function. It is then trained using the training data for 30 epochs, while validation is performed on the test set.

```python
# Compile the model with optimizer, loss, and metrics
model.compile(optimizer="adam",
              loss="sparse_categorical_crossentropy",
              metrics=["accuracy"])

# Train the model
history = model.fit(xtrain, ytrain, epochs=30, validation_data=(xtest, ytest))

# Evaluate the model on the test set
loss, acc = model.evaluate(xtest, ytest, verbose=False)
```

**Explanation:**  
- Compilation sets up the training configuration.
- Training uses 30 epochs, and the validation data helps to monitor overfitting or underfitting.
- Post-training evaluation provides final test set performance metrics.

## Performance Visualization

Two plots are created to visualize the evolution of accuracy and loss for both training and validation sets during training.

### Plotting Accuracy

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(20,5))
plt.subplot(1,2,1)
plt.plot(history.history['accuracy'], color="b", label="Training Accuracy")
plt.plot(history.history["val_accuracy"], color="r", label="Validation Accuracy")
plt.legend(loc="lower right")
plt.xlabel("Epoch", fontsize=16)
plt.ylabel("Accuracy", fontsize=16)
plt.ylim([min(plt.ylim()), 1])
plt.title("Training and Test Performance Graph", fontsize=16)
```

### Plotting Loss

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(20,5))
plt.subplot(1,2,2)
plt.plot(history.history["loss"], color="b", label="Training Loss")
plt.plot(history.history["val_loss"], color="r", label="Validation Loss")
plt.legend(loc="upper right")
plt.xlabel("Epoch", fontsize=16)
plt.ylabel("Loss", fontsize=16)
plt.ylim([0, max(plt.ylim())])
plt.title("Training and Test Loss Graph", fontsize=16)
plt.show()
```

**Explanation:**  
- The accuracy plot displays both training and validation accuracy over epochs.
- The loss plot similarly shows the loss trend.
- These visualizations help in diagnosing the model’s training dynamics.

## Model Predictions and Evaluation

### Generating Predictions

Predictions are made on the test set and processed to extract the predicted class labels.

```python
ypred = model.predict(xtest)
ypred1 = [np.argmax(element) for element in ypred]
print(ypred[:3])
print(ypred1[:3])
```

**Explanation:**  
- `model.predict` outputs probabilities for each class.
- The `np.argmax` operation converts these probabilities to class labels.

### Comparing True vs. Predicted Classes

A sample comparison is printed for selected true and predicted class labels using the defined `classname` list.

```python
# Example true classes (manually set for demonstration)
y_true = [3, 8, 8, 0]

# Example predicted classes (manually adjusted for demonstration)
ypred1 = [3, 8, 1, 0]

# Compare and print the true and predicted class names
for true, pred in zip(y_true[:3], ypred1[:3]):
    print("True Class:", classname[true], "\tPredicted Class:", classname[pred])
```

### Classification Report

The classification report is generated using scikit-learn to provide metrics such as precision, recall, and f1-score.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Combine y_true and ypred1 to determine unique labels (this is a demonstration subset)
unique_labels = sorted(list(set(y_true + ypred1)))
selected_target_names = [classname[label] for label in unique_labels]

# Print the classification report
print(classification_report(y_true, ypred1, target_names=selected_target_names))
```

**Explanation:**  
- The report summarizes the model’s performance on a per-class basis.
- Unique labels and corresponding class names are computed to format the report correctly.

### Scatter Plot: True vs. Predicted

A scatter plot is created to visualize the correlation between the true labels and the model’s predicted labels.

```python
# Generate predictions on the test set and adjust the predicted values to the length of the test set
ypred = model.predict(xtest)
ypred1 = [np.argmax(element) for element in ypred]
ypred1 = ypred1[:len(ytest)]

# Create a scatter plot to compare true and predicted values
plt.scatter(ytest, ypred1, alpha=0.5)
plt.xlabel("True Values")
plt.ylabel("Predicted Values")
plt.title("True vs. Predicted")
plt.plot([min(ytest), max(ytest)], [min(ytest), max(ytest)], "r--")  # Diagonal reference line
plt.show()
```

**Explanation:**  
- The scatter plot visualizes the alignment between true labels and predictions.
- The diagonal line represents perfect prediction alignment.
